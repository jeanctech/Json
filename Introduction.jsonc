//? Introduction - Json

/* Json, which means "JavaScript Object Notation" in Spanish "JavaScript Object Notation", is a
Data exchange format widely used in the world of programming and computing.
It was designed to be a lighter, human-readable alternative to other data formats, such as XML
(Extensible Markup Language). Json has become a de facto standard in exchanging data between
web applications, web services, NoSql databases and more. */

//? Key Features of Json

//* 1. **Simple Syntax:**

/* Json uses a key-value pair structure to represent structured data. It's easy to understand
and read by both humans and machines. The data is organized into objects (called Json objects) and
arrays, which are nested to create more complex structures. */

//* 2. **Language Independent:**

/* Json is programming language independent, meaning it can be used in a wide range of applications.
variety of platforms and systems. This makes it ideal for communication between applications written in
different languages. */

//* 3. **Supported Data Types:**

/* Json supports common data types, such as numbers, strings, booleans, objects, arrays, and the
special value `null`. */

//* 4. **Wide Adoption:**

/* Json has become a standard in software development. It is used in web applications,
web services, NoSql databases and more. */

//* 5. **Lightness:**

/* Json is a lightweight data format compared to other formats, making it efficient in
terms of bandwidth usage and data transfer speed. */

//* 6. **Facilitates Interoperability:**

/* Json is essential for communication between applications and services in web applications. Its
simplicity and versatility facilitate interoperability and systems integration. */

//* 7. **Simplifies Development:**

/* Working with Json is easy. Most modern programming languages have support i
built-in to parse and generate Json, making it easy to deploy applications that require the
structured data exchange. */

/* In short, Json is a versatile and widely adopted data format that has transformed the way we
Applications and systems exchange information. Its simplicity, language independence and capacity
to represent data clearly make it essential in modern software development. Whether in
the creation of Apis, in the transmission of data in web applications or in the storage of information in
NoSql databases, Json plays a fundamental role in today's computing. */
