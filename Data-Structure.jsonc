//! Data Structure - Json

/* Unlike some data formats like Xml, Json itself does not define a formal schema for
validate the data structure. In its basic form, Json is flexible and allows a wide variety of
data structures, making it easy to use in a wide range of applications. However, in some
cases, it is necessary to define a specific structure or schema for Json data, especially in
applications where accurate validation of input or output data is required. */

// To define a specific schema or structure in Json, you can follow some common approaches:

//* 1. **Json Schema:**

/* Json Schema is a standard that allows defining schemas for Json documents.
Provides a way to specify the structure, data types, and validation constraints of a
Json document. You can define a J schema that describes how data should be structured in your
application. */

    // Json Schema example

      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "name": { "type": "string" },
        "age": { "type": "number" },
        "city": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "required": ["name", "age"]

//* 2. **Documentation and specification:**

/* Instead of using a formal outline, you can document the
structure of your Json data in your application documentation. Provide examples of how
structure the data and the constraints that must be met. */

//* 3. **Custom validation:**

/* You can implement custom validation in your application to
verify that the Json data meets the desired structure. This involves writing code that inspects
  and validate the data according to your criteria. /*

//* 4. **Libraries and validation tools:**

/* You can also use Json validation libraries and tools in your programming language.
These libraries can help you apply custom validation rules or validate data
based on a defined Json schema. */

/* Choosing an approach depends on your needs and the complexity of the validation required in your
application. If you need rigorous and structured validation, Json Schema is a solid option. If the
Validation is simpler, you can opt for documentation or custom validation. In any
case, it is important to ensure that the Json data used in your application meets the requirements of
necessary structure and quality. */
