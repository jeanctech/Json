## What is Json?

Json JavaScript object notation is a simple text format for exchanging data. It's a
subset of JavaScript's object literal notation, although due to its widespread adoption
As an alternative to Xml, it is considered a language-independent format.

## Introduction

One of the supposed advantages of Json over Xml as a data exchange format is that it is much more
easy to write a parser for it. In JavaScript, a Json text can be easily parsed using the
eval() function, something that - due to the ubiquity of JavaScript in almost any web browser - has been
essential for it to have been accepted by the Ajax developer community.

## Important information and frequently asked questions

Currently the course is in process. The basic, intermediate and backend blocks have been started, and that was
the initial objective of the project. And then I don't rule out adding new lessons in the future, but I think that
For now, it can serve as a base for anyone who wants to start learning this language.

*As soon as the course continues I will update the repository and notify the networks.
Thank you very much for all the support shown!
