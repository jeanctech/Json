# **Json - Documentation**

## **What is Json?**

### Json - JavaScript Object Notation is a simple text format for exchanging data. It is a subset of JavaScript's object literal notation, although due to its widespread adoption as an alternative to XML, it is considered a language-independent format

### **Introduction**

#### One of the supposed advantages of Json over Xml as a data exchange format is that it is much easier to write a parser for it. In JavaScript, a Json text can be easily parsed using the eval() function, something that - due to the ubiquity of JavaScript in almost any web browser - has been essential for it to have been accepted by the Ajax developer community
